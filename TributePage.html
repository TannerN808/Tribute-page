            “By now, it is probably very late at night, and you have stayed up to read this book when you should have 
            gone to sleep. If this is the case, then I commend you for falling into my trap. It is a writer's greatest 
            pleasure to hear that someone was kept up until the unholy hours of the morning reading one of his books. 
            It goes back to authors being terrible people who delight in the suffering of others. Plus, we get a kickback 
            from the caffeine industry...”
